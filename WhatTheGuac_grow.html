		How can you grow your own avocado tree into a beautiful tree like this? Read on for tips and tricks! 
		<br><br>
		This tree pictured here is a Hass avocado tree and was grown in Southern California. It is about 50 years old!
		<br>
		Avocado trees do extremely well in Southern California - the Mediterranean-style weather is ideal for them to thrive. 
		<br>
		<br>
		When planting your avocado tree, make sure to give it plenty of room, since over time it can get quite large! 
		<br>
		Avocado trees need lots of sunlight, too, so make sure it is planted in an area that receives full sun. 
		<br>
		Water is also critial! Avocado trees, especially full-grown ones, require a good amount of water. It is recommended for outdoor avocado trees to have a sprinkler system on an auto-water schedule so that you won't forget! We recommend watering 3 times per week for about 10 mintues on a sprinkler system for full-grown outdoor avocado trees. For indoor or potted avocado trees that aren't full-grown, you might need to water 3-4 times per week depending on how dry or warm you keep your house.

		You can buy an avocado tree from a local nursery, or you can grow your own from a pit from an avocado that you either bought from the grocery store or maybe a friend gave you from their avocado tree! To grow one from a pit like the one in the image here, you will need:
		<br><br>
		1 cup that you can fill with water that is a little wider that the pit
		<br>
		Water
		<br>
		3-4 toothpicks
		<br>
		Your chosen avocado pit!
		<br><br>
		Rise the pit off first and peel away the outer layer of the pit's loose skin. Push your toothpicks into the pit around the widest part of the center a little bit - you don't want to push them all the way in, of course - just enough so that the pit will be secure and that the toothpicks can rest on the sides of the water glass. 
		<br>
		Next, place the broad end of the pit facing downwards in the cup and fill the cup with lukewarm or room temperature water so that it covers about half of an inch of the pit. Maintain this water level and watch closely! 
		<br><br>
		Eventually - and be patient because this next step can take a few weeks - your pit will start to sprout! When the main stem reaches about 7 inches you can cut it back halfway to make it grow stronger. Once you notice the roots developing and the stem has started to leaf out, you're ready to plant it in a pot. A 7.5 - 9.5 inch pot with drainage holes is best. Also, it is recommended to use rocks or something similar in the bottom half inch of the pot before you put the soil in to help drainage. For soil, a rich, hummus-type soil is best and your local nursery can help you choose one.

		There are actually many different types of avocados! 
		<br><br>
		Hass and Fuerte are the most popular choices and are often sold at most nurseries. Hass are smaller and rounder in shape and have an excellent texture, which makes them a great choice for guacamole. They are also the leading variety of California Avocado. Fuerte are larger and more of a teardrop shape and are also a great choice for most recipes. They are a high-quality California Avocado.
		<br><br>
		If you're willing to shop around a bit, you can find other varieties of avocado such as Bacon which is medium-sized, Lamb Hass which is a little larger than a regular Hass, Pinkerton which has a more elongated shape, Puebla which has black-colored skin when ripe, and many more. <br>
